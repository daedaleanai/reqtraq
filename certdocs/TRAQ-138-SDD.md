### Definitions of Acronyms and Terms

#### Description of Terms

- Changelist: a git commit resulting in the creation, revision, or deletion of any version controlled material.

## Software Overview

### Inputs and Outputs

Data comes in from the requirements documents and code files in the same Git repository.

Reqtraq has the following outputs:
- Traceability reports and issues, including hyperlinking between documents
- The next available requirement <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>

### Software Design and Implementation Details

Any report is generated from a `reqGraph` object which is a dictionary of
requirements by IDs at a particular Git commit. A requirement is represented by
an instance of the `Req` data structure.

## Low-level Software Requirements Identification

The SWLs of the system are as follows:


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-1 Requirements storage

Requirements SHALL be stored in Markdown files version controlled by Git.
Reqtraq is not responsible for the actual formatting or version control of each
document. Instead Reqtraq leverages Git for storage and version control and
Markdown for formatting.

Reqtraq will discover all the `.md` files in the `certdocs` directory and will
parse them as certification documents to look for requirements.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Git is the industry standard for version control. Markdown is widespread and the lightweight format is well suited for version controlled documents that need to be peer reviewed.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-20 Certification document names

Reqtraq will check the validity of a certification document name by checking the
parts delimited by `-`:

1. Project abbreviation, which shall be the same for all the certification documents of a system, e.g. "TRAQ"
2. Document type sequence number, e.g. "138"
3. Document type, e.g. "SDD"

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Consistency helps in the development process, to know where to find various certification documents.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-14 Accessing and linking to requirements

Each time a change to a requirement document is committed, Reqtraq SHALL parse
the document and alter the following information:

- each requirement described in the document, is wrapped into a **named anchor** so that the requirement can be directly linked to, e.g.

```
<a name="#REQ-TRAQ-SWL-1">REQ-TRAQ-SWL-1</a>
```

- each requirement referred to in the document is replaced with a link to that requirement. For example a reference to the High Level Requirement REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1 will be replaced with:

```
<a href="https://a/REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1">REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1</a>
```

Where `http://a` is the Daedalean URL redirector. The URL redirector will infer
the name of the document where the requirement is defined (TRAQ-137-SRD in our
case) and use the Google Drive API or other methods to find the URL of the
document, then redirect to it.

Note that the URL redirector needs to infer the name of the document the
requirement is defined in, as described in REQ-TRAQ-SWL-2.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: this ensures that all documents defining or reference requirements don’t introduce typing mistakes.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-12
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-2 Construct the requirement URL.

The <abbr title="Requirements Management Tool">RMT</abbr> SHALL infer the
document where a requirement is defined solely based on the name of the
requirement. The correct name as defined by REQ-TRAQ-SWL-20 can be uniquely
constructed as follows:

- take the second part of the requirement id, representing the project/system abbrev, e.g. "TRAQ" for "REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1"
- depending on the third part of the requirement id, representing the requirement type, append the document type:
  - for SWL and <abbr title="Hardware Low-Level Requirement">HWL</abbr>, append `-138-SDD`
  - for SWH and <abbr title="Hardware High-Level Requirement">HWH</abbr>, append `-137-SRD`
  - for <abbr title="System-Level Requirement">SYS</abbr>, append `-100-ORD`

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: simplicity and completeness: the ability to find a requirement only based on its name simplifies the development and the verification process.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-3 Uniform requirement ID format.

The RMT SHALL check that the requirements defined in each document have a
correct id, composed of four parts separated by `-`:

1. `REQ`

2. the project/system abbrev, identical to the first part of the document name where the requirement is defined, e.g. "TRAQ" for "TRAQ-100-ORD.md"

3. the requirement type:
    - `SYS` for system/overall requirements (defined in ORD documents)
    - `SWH` for software high-level requirements (defined in SRD documents)
    - `SWL` for software low-level requirements (defined in SDD documents)
    - `HWH` for hardware high-level requirements (defined in HRD documents)
    - `HWL` for hardware low-level requirements (defined in HDD documents)

4. a sequence number n such that requirements 1, 2, ..., n all exist, not necessarily in order

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: correct IDs are essential for tracing requirements.
- Verification: Unit test.
- Safety impact: None.
- Parent: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-2


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-4 Valid requirement references.

The RMT SHALL check that the requirements referred to in each document exist
(and thus have a correct id):

- for each requirement reference, check if the referenced requirement exists in the requirement map constructed as described in REQ-TRAQ-SWL-15

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: invalid requirement references indicate an error in the requirement construction
- Verification: Unit test.
- Safety impact: None.
- Parent: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-2


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-5 ID allocation.

The RMT SHALL check that given a requirement ID with sequence number N, all
requirements with the same prefix and sequence numbers 0...N-1 exist and are
defined in the current document (in any order).

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: This helps ensure that no requirement sequence numbers are accidentally skipped.
- Verification: Unit test.
- Safety impact: None.
- Parent: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-3


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-17 Deleted requirements

Deleted requirements are requirements that do not apply anymore (e.g. they are
obsolete). A requirement can be marked as deleted by replacing or prefixing the
title with `DELETED`, for example: `REQ-TRAQ-SWL-15 DELETED`.

Deleted requirements SHALL not be checked for completeness.

All references to a deleted requirement SHALL be reported as errors.

Reqtraq SHALL check that requirements at the end of the numbering sequence are
not entirely deleted.

Reqtraq SHALL check that new requirements are not marked as deleted.

Reqtraq SHALL check the deleted requirements are kept at the end so they don't
clutter the document.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: We can detect invalid references to an obsolete requirement only if it's marked as deleted without erasing it.
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None
- Parent: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-3


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-15 Data structure for keeping requirements and their hierarchy

The interface between the parsing tool and the report generation tool SHALL be a
data structure that maps requirement IDs to a requirement structure. The
requirement structure will hold all the data about the requirement that is
needed for the report generation (ID, body, attributes, parents, children,
etc.). The data structure is built by traversing the entire git repository and
parsing:

- `.md` certification documents files that may define requirements,
- `.cc`, `.hh`, `.go` source files that may reference requirements.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: this data structure will be used for report generation and graph verification.
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-4, REQ-TRAQ-SWH-5


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-22 Safety impact propagation

The RMT SHALL enforce that the Safety impact of a requirement is passed on to
the children requirement(s) if not `None`.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Requirements with a Safety impact are important and the ones they depend on are also.
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-21

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-23 Safety impact origination

The RMT SHALL enforce that the Safety impact of a requirement originates from at
least one parent requirement.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Requirements with a Safety impact are important, and at least one parent is also.
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-21

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-6 Tracing system to high, low level, implementation, test

Given a list of requirements, the RMT SHALL be able to generate parent and child
requirements and code ordered from system to high level to low level requirement
to implementation and test, including missing continuations.

###### Report structure

The information will be organized as following:

- SYSTEM\_REQUIREMENT\_1

    - Status: not started/started (% complete)/completed

    - Open issues: &lt;number of open issues&gt;

    - HIGH\_LEVEL\_REQUIREMENT\_1

        - Status: not started/started (% complete)/completed

        - Open issues: &lt;number of open issues&gt;

        - LOW\_LEVEL\_REQUIREMENT\_1

            - Status: not started/started (% complete)/completed

            - Open issues: enumerate open issue IDs

            - Source files: list the source files implementing this requirement

        - LOW\_LEVEL\_REQUIREMENT\_2

            - ...

    - HIGH\_LEVEL\_REQUIREMENT\_2

        - ...

- SYSTEM\_REQUIREMENT\_2

    - ...

**Note 1:** The above list will show "denormalized" requirements, in the sense that if a requirement has multiple parents, it will be listed under each parent. To facilitate readability, the full information will be displayed only the first time a requirement appears, otherwise a link to the first occurrence is used.

**Note 2:** The completion status of SYS, SWH or HWH is:
- not started, if none of the children are started
- started, if at least one child is started
- completed, if \*all\* children are completed

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: the report will be used by the certification authority to visualize requirement tracing.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-4
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-7. Tracing implementation, test to low, high, system level.

Given a list of requirements, the RMT SHALL be able to generate parent and child requirements and code, ordered from implementation or test to low level, high level to system requirement, including missing continuations.

**Note:** This is identical to REQ-TRAQ-SWL-6, except that the report is generated in reverse order.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: the report will be used by the certification authority to visualize requirement tracing.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-5
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-8. Change impact tracing

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all requirements changed between checked in versions of the project’s documentation, for use as input to the high-to-low and low-to-high tracing functions.

The report generation described in REQ-TRAQ-SWL-6 will be able to receive the following inputs:

- no input: in this case Reqtraq will generate a global HTML report listing all the requirements, from system to high level to low level, defined in the project associated with the repository (each project has its own Git repository)

- a list of requirement IDs (system, high level or low level): in this case the report will be generated for the given requirements, plus all their direct/indirect children. The direct/indirect parent requirements will also be listed, but all children other than the ones requested will be omitted.

- two git commit IDs (or git refs): in this case the report will contain all requirements that were changed between the given commits. If the 2nd commit id is missing, the current state of the repository is used.

Suggested usage (the directory in which Reqtraq is run determines the project for which the report is generated):

```
reqtraq report 
reqtraq report REQ-TRAQ-SWL-8,REQ-TRAQ-SWL-9
reqtraq report d6cd1e2bd19e03a81132a23b2025920577f84e37
```

Note: a requirement is considered "changed" if either it was directly edited or one of the child requirements was edited.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: the report will be used by the certification authority to visualize requirements that changed within a period of time.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-6
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-18 DELETED


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-9. Change history tracing

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all changelists that touched the
definition or implementation of a given set of requirements, and the
corresponding Problem Reports that these changelists belong to.

The report described in REQ-TRAQ-SWL-6 addresses this requirement. Each LLR will
contain both the source files that implement it and the CLs that implemented it.

###### Attributes:
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-7
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-10 DELETED


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-11. Output

The output, such as reports, SHALL be created as HTML.

This applies for example to the report generated in REQ-TRAQ-SWL-6.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: The HTML can be used to create static HTML files and also to serve pages in the web app.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-9, REQ-TRAQ-SWH-13
- Verification: Demonstration.
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-12. Filtering of output

The report generation tool SHALL allow filtering by matching a regular expression against:

- requirement id
- requirement title
- requirement description/body

Suggested usage:
```
reqtraq report --title_filter="Motion estimation"
reqtraq report --id_filter="REQ-TRAQ-SWL-.*"
reqtraq report --body_filter="reprojection error"
```

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: useful in the development or verification phase to check a subset of requirements.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-10
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-16 Web interface

The RMT tool SHALL support starting up a simple web interface for report generation. The syntax for starting up the web interface will be:

```
reqtraq web [:<port>]
```

The command must be executed in the repository for which the reports will be generated.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: useful for report navigation and easy report generation.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-13
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-21 Requirement definition detection (ATX heading)

Reqtraq SHALL discover requirements definitions in certification documents `.md` files by detecting the beginning and end:
  - a requirement starts with an [ATX heading](https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-headings) which has at the beginning a requirement ID
  - a requirement ends when another requirement starts, or when a higher-level heading starts.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Using existing markdown elements is preferable to introducing new syntax
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-13 Requirement attributes (ATX heading)

The RMT SHALL read the attributes of each requirement from the attributes section at the end of the requirement definition. The attributes section starts with an [ATX heading](https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-headings) with the title "Attributes:". Since attributes belong to a requirement, the attribute ATX heading level will be higher than the containing requirement heading level. For example, a requirement defined with an ATX heading level of 3 will have attributes with ATX heading level 4 or higher.

The requirement attributes are formatted one per line:

    ###### Attributes:
    - NAME1: VALUE1
    - NAME2: VALUE2

Attributes can be optional or mandatory. Each attribute has a name. Each attribute may have an associated regular expression to test for validity. Attributes are specified in an `attributes.json` file in the `certdocs` directory. For example, the `attributes.json` for the current document would be:

```
{ "attributes": [
  { "name": "Parent", "optional": false }, 
  { "name": "Verification", "value": "(Demonstration|Unit Test)", "optional": false },
  { "name": "Safety Impact", "optional": false } ] }
```

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Attributes help define the importance of and the verification process for each requirement. Missing attributes indicate an incomplete requirement.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-11
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-24 Requirement definition detection (tables)

Reqtraq SHALL discover requirements definitions held in [tables]( https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-) in certification documents `.md` files by detecting the beginning and end:
  - a requirement table starts with a header row where the first column has the text "ID"
  - a requirement table ends when a non-table row is encountered.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Using existing markdown elements is preferable to introducing new syntax
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-25 Requirement attributes (tables)

The RMT SHALL read the attributes of each requirement held in a requirement table from each column of the table. The first row of the table contains the attribute name for each column, the first column being "ID" to represent requirement ID. The second row is a delimiter. The third row onward contains the requirement ID and associated attribute text as shown:

> | ID | Title | Body | Attribute1 | Attribute2 |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | ReqID1 | <text> | <text> | <text> | <text> |
> | ReqID2 | <text> | <text> | <text> | <text> |


As with ATX headings, attributes can be optional or mandatory as specified in the `attributes.json` file.


###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Attributes help define the importance of and the verification process for each requirement. Missing attributes indicate an incomplete requirement.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-11
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None


##### REQ-TRAQ-SWL-19 Pandoc markdown rendering

The RMT tool SHALL invoke pandoc to convert markdown (and pandoc extensions like math, tables, and code) into HTML that correctly renders into generated reports.

* Requirements bodies can include code that is delimited with the triple-backtick delimiter (\```), which results in rendered HTML as follows:
```
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        FlyAirplane();
}
```


* Requirements bodies can include math (both inline and display) that is delimited with the single dollar sign (\$) for inline, and the double dollar
sign (\$$) for display. They will be rendered in HTML reports using MathJax and look as follows:
    * Inline math: $x=y$
    * Display math:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).
$$

* Requirements bodies can include tables in any of the four pandoc table formats. An example simple table is shown here:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
             *Alpha*         *Beta*              *Gamma*
----------   -------------   -----------------   --------------------
    Monday     3 Watts        2 pints             3 chickens,
                                                  1 hr at charger

   Tuesday    14 Kilograms    1 Penguin,          1 cheese sandwich
                              2 Thunderbird

 Wednesday    2 aspirin       Tall space ship    (can't remember)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Table:  *Table of nonsense*, deluxe edition




###### Attributes:
- Rationale: pandoc is a markdown to HTML converter that has markdown-extensions for math, tables, and code.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-14
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None


### Other Assumptions

In the creation of these requirements it was assumed that Reqtraq users use Git for version control.
