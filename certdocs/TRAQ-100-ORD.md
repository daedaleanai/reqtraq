## Introduction

Reqtraq is our <abbr title="Requirements Management Tool">RMT</abbr>.

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Reqtraq system. The requirements will define the system needs and will be used for development of the hardware and software requirements documents. It complies with section 5.3 of SAE-4754A / ED-79A and Daedalean AG’s <abbr title="Software Requirements Standards">SRS</abbr>.

The purpose of the Reqtraq tool is to comply with the DO-178C / ED-12C traceability data requirements.

### Scope

This document discusses the following topics:
- Report generation
- Traceability of requirements data, change data
- Compliance with formatting
- Assumptions

- Problem report: a change request identifying a missing, non-functioning, or non-compliant feature.

## Reqtraq System Overview

### System Goals

Reqtraq's goal is to ensure bidirectional traceability throughout all levels of requirements and to identify faults in that traceability. In fulfilling these goals, Reqtraq generates various reports and prevents the introduction of errors by requiring compliance with the Reqtraq system.

## Requirements Overview

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements identify what is necessary to obtain the desired performance of the system under the listed operational modes and conditions. This category includes and is developed through a combination of customer, operational, performance, physical and installation, maintainability, security, and interface restrictions, wishes, and requirements. Functional requirements are defined and written according the section 5.3 of ARP 4754A / ED-79A.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-7 Requirement Document Types

The RMT SHALL allow tracking of the following requirements document types:

- Overall Requirements Document, which contains <abbr title="System-Level Requirements">SYS</abbr>
- Software/Hardware Requirements Documents, which contain <abbr title="High-Level Requirements">HLR</abbr>
- Software/Hardware Design Documents, which contain <abbr title="Low-Level Requirements">LLR</abbr>.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: These documents contain the three levels of requirements, at varying levels of product development, that retraq parses to establish traceability.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-8 Requirement Document Hierarchy

The hierarchical relationship of requirements documents SHALL be as follows:

- Software/Hardware Design Documents will have exactly one parent Software/Hardware Requirements Document.
- Software/Hardware Requirements Documents will have exactly one parent Overall Requirements Document.
- Overall Requirements Documents will have zero or one parent Overall Requirements Document.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: This structure ensures traceability from high-level concepts to implementation.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1 Bidirectional tracing

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all requirements given to or generated by a given project:

1. ordered from system to high level to low level requirement to implementation and test,

2. ordered from implementation or test to low level, high level to system requirement,

3. showing the implementation status (i.e. completeness of the trace) in either direction.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: the requirements form a graph that should be navigable in either direction. Bidirectional traceability is then equivalent to completeness of the paths.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-2. Change impact tracing.

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all requirements changed between checked in versions of the project’s documentation, and the details of the change, in the same three orders as the bidirectional tracing function.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: certification authority must be able to see changes between two audits.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-3. Change history tracing.

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all changelists that touched the definition or implementation of a given set of requirements, and the corresponding Problem Reports that these changelists belong to.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: certification authority must be able to verify that each requirement was appropriately implemented.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-4. Change justification tracing.

The RMT SHALL guarantee that changelists touching definitions or implementation of a requirement have a rationale-for-change field.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: all changes must be vetted and verified by an independent reviewer.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-5. DERIVED.

This is the placeholder System Requirement for derived <abbr title="High Level Requirement">HLR</abbr>s.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: derived HLRs must have a parent requirement.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-6. Requirement Attributes.

The RMT SHALL allow tracking of at least the following attributes of requirements: Verification Method, Safety Impact, Priority (urgent/important).

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: these attributes define the importance, impact and the verification process for each requirement.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.

#### REQ-TRAQ-SYS-9. External Parent Requirements

The RMT SHALL allow for optional, non-traced External Parent Requirements for System-Level Requirements.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Large organisations may have compartmentalised divisions that follow different requirement tracing protocols. This allows for collaboration in these situations.
- Verification: Test.
- Safety impact: None.


### Other Assumptions

In the creation of these requirements it was assumed that Reqtraq users use Git for version control.
