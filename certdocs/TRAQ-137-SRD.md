## Reqtraq Software Overview

### Software Goals

Reqtraq's goal is to ensure bidirectional traceability throughout all levels of requirements and to identify faults in that traceability. In fulfilling these goals, Reqtraq generates various reports and prevents the introduction of errors by requiring compliance with the Reqtraq system.

Reqtraq should be as lightweight as possible and allow for human and machine interaction.
