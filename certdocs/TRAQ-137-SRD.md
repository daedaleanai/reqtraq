## Software Overview

### Software Goals

Reqtraq's goal is to ensure bidirectional traceability throughout all levels of requirements and to identify faults in that traceability. In fulfilling these goals, Reqtraq generates various reports and prevents the introduction of errors by requiring compliance with the Reqtraq system.

### Functional Requirements

#### High-Level Requirements

The SWH requirements of the system are as follows:

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-1 Requirements Storage

The RMT SHALL persistently store and retrieve requirements and their change history in the controlled document repository in the form of `.md` files.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: requirements must be change-controlled. We do this in Git repositories. The RMT must use this and only this to store the requirements. Work done in Git repositories is tracked in a separate PR/ticket system, but all data that needs to be controlled shall be stored with the commits in Git.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1, REQ-TRAQ-SYS-2, REQ-TRAQ-SYS-3, REQ-TRAQ-SYS-4
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-12 Requirements Linking

Given a requirement ID, one should be able to easily navigate to the requirement definition without any extra information. That is, the requirement ID should uniquely identify the file where the requirement is defined. As a consequence, Reqtraq will be able to construct a link to any requirement referenced in a document.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: easy navigation of the requirement hierarchy is essential both for development and for verification.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-2 Uniform requirement ID format

The RMT SHALL enforce a uniform requirement ID format. Defined to be:

REQ-[project/system number]-[project/system abbreviation]-[SYS or SWH or SWL or HWH or HWL]-[a unique alphanumeric sequence]

e.g.: REQ-TRAQ-SWH-2

There is no special notation for derived requirements.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Tracing is only possible if requirements have unambiguous identifiers.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-3 ID allocation

The RMT SHALL enforce that requirement numbers are allocated without repetition or gaps. Deleted requirements are replaced by placeholders.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: It is easier to track no requirements have fallen through the cracks if the tools to manipulate them can check they are all enumerated.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-5
- Verification: Unit test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-4 Tracing system to high, low level, implementation, test

The RMT SHALL, given a list of requirements given to or generated by the project as checked in to the repository, be able to generate parent and child requirements and code ordered from system to high level to low level requirement to implementation and test, including missing continuations.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: an incomplete requirement graph indicates that some requirements were not fulfilled.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1
- Verification: Test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-5 Tracing implementation, test to low, high, system level

The RMT SHALL, given a list of requirements given to or generated by the project as checked in to the repository, be able to generate lists of parent and child requirements and code, ordered from implementation or test to low level, high level to system requirement, including missing continuations.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: an incomplete requirement graph indicates that some requirements were not fulfilled.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-1
- Verification: Test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-6 Change impact tracing

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all requirements changed between checked in versions of the project’s documentation, for use as input to the high-to-low and low-to-high tracing functions.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: certification authority must be able to see the changes that happened in a period of time, e.g. between two successive audits.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-2
- Verification: Test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-7 Change history tracing

The RMT SHALL be able to generate a list of all changelists that touched the definition or implementation of a given set of requirements, and the corresponding lists of Problem Reports that these changelists belong to.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: certification authority must be able to verify that the implementation of each requirement followed the appropriate process.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-3
- Verification: Test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-8 Change justification tracing

The RMT SHALL verify and flag violations that changelists touching definitions or implementation of a requirement have a rationale-for-change field.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: no changes should be allowed unless they were vetted and the justification accepted by an independent reviewer.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-3
- Verification: Test
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-9 Output readability

The output from this tool SHALL be available in a pretty printable form.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: reports on the bidirectional traceability have to be submitted as evidence in certification trajectories.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-6
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-10 Output filtering

The requirement sets of all the above outputs SHALL be filterable by regular expressions on the contents.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: to be of use in daily routine, the tool should allow quick querying by developers.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-5
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-11 Attribute storage and verification

The RMT SHALL be able to store a number of predefined attributes and enforce/flag mandatory/optional rules for them.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Attributes help define the importance of and the verification process for each requirement. Missing attributes indicate an incomplete requirement.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-6
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

### Software Interfaces Requirements

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-13 Web interface

The report generation tool SHALL have a simple web interface that allows generation and filtering of reports.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: since the reports we generate are easier to navigate online, a web interface will allow generating and navigating reports on the fly. It also opens up report generation and verification to people who are less comfortable with a command line tool.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-5
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

##### REQ-TRAQ-SWH-14 Requirement Rich Formatting

The RMT SHALL allow for us to express rich markdown concepts in requirements descriptions, e.g. math, tables, and code.

###### Attributes:
- Rationale: Technical Requiments often need to document equations, tables of data, or code.
- Parents: REQ-TRAQ-SYS-6
- Verification: Demonstration
- Safety impact: None

### Other Assumptions

In the creation of these requirements it was assumed that Reqtraq users use Git for version control.
